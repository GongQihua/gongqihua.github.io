# 📝 Research

**Experimental Setup for Myoelectric Prosthesis Control, *05/2022-09/2022***

Position：Student Researcher

Mentor: Dr. Nitish V. Thakor, Professor of Biomedical Engineering

- Preparing for an upcoming experiment that involves wirelessly transmitting data from electrodes implanted in an animal subject.

- Decoding the animal simulate signals to control a virtual prosthetic.

- Collecting animal simulation data measured from different electrodes, such as 'rest', 'power', 'open', 'pronante', 'supinate'. Use neural network models and machine training to analyze data and discuss in groups and build models that are convenient for future topic analysis.

- Using python and microcontrollers (Arduino) to help with some miscellaneous systems tasks necessary for the experimental setup.

**Machine Learning in Object Detection, *01/2020-05/2021***

Position：Student Researcher

Mentor: Dr. Dong Xu, Professor and Director of Information Technology

- Implemented precision protein cell analytics with object detection.

-	Designed a deep learning model with Fast-RCNN network to detect the position of textboxes, arrowheads, and T-bar handles in the cell.

-	Implemented a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model-based recognition engine with OCR tools and Tesseract.

-	Expanded a small sub-project, utilized a small amount of image data to reduce the recognition and annotation errors in the existing model machine learning through image processing.

-	Completed the machine learning and predictive labeling of T-bar and compound in the protein gene model.

# 📖 Projects

**Cervical Spine Fracture Detection with Deep Learning, *09/2022-12/2022***

Mentor: Dr. Najim Dehak, Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

-	Preprocessing the skeleton image of each vertebra, masking and doing semantic segmentation, then extracting and separating the slices.

-	Developing and testing machine learning models that match the radiologists' performance in detecting and localizing fractures to the seven vertebrae that comprise the cervical spine.

-	Predicting a probability for a fracture at each of the seven cervical vertebrae designated as C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7.

-	Making 2D and 3D animations of the fracture detection to intuitively display the results.

**Extending Fragrance Lifetime of Candles through Electromagnetic Induction, *08/2020-05/2021***

Mentor：Dr. Jae Kwon, Professor of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science

-	Developed a novel method to extend candles fragrance lifetime and replace the standard candle warmer.

-	Compared Heating methods such as cartridge insertion rods, ceramic heating chambers, and electromagnetic induction.

-	Generated heat locally to evenly melt the wax ribbon, and selectively heated the candle wax from top to bottom to mimic a candle melting to release a fragrance as well as extending the lifetime of fragrances.

-	Investigated various sensors to determine our best suites.

-	Reviewed the potential for Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities for seamless user integration.

**Architectural Robotics Design, *01/2020-05/2020***

Mentor：Dr. Marjorie Skubic, Professor and Center Director

-	Design the Code program of the robot with Arduino to control the operation of the robot.
